git-check-mailmap(1)
====================

NAME
----
git-check-mailmap - Show canonical mappings of names and email addresses


SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git check-mailmap' [options] <contact>...


DESCRIPTION
-----------

For each ``Name $$<email@address>$$'' or ``$$<email@address>$$'' provided on
the command-line or standard input (when using `--stdin`), prints a line with
the canonical contact information for that person according to the 'mailmap'
(see "Mapping Authors" below). If no mapping exists for the person, echoes the
provided contact information.


OPTIONS
-------
--stdin::
	Read contacts, one per line, from the standard input after exhausting
	contacts provided on the command-line.

-z::
--null::
	Terminate each printed contact line with a null character `\0` rather
	than a newline.


OUTPUT
------

For each contact, a single line is printed of the form ``Name
$$<email@address>$$'' if the name is provided or known to the 'mailmap'; or of
the form ``$$<email@address>$$'' if no name is provided or known. Each line is
terminated by a newline, or by a null character `\0` when `-z` or `--null` is
specified.
